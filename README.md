# Predict gender based on Chinese name

Research shows that a baby's Chinese names is related to their gender. There are many characters are considered masculine or feminine.[^1][^2] So I tried to predict a person's gender based on their Chinese name using neural networks.

Please note that this is my toy project for learning AI knowledge. Please do not use it to assume other's genders, which may be disrespectful to females (or males) with names that are traditionally considered masculine (or feminine).
